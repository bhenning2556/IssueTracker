        <h1>Issue Tracker SRS</h1>
        <h3>Author: Benjamin Henning, developer</h3>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        <h3>1.1. Purpose</h3>
        <p>This System Requirements Specification (SRS) documentation will describe the functionality, requirements and constraints of the Issue Tracker application. This document will cover system features, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, external interface requirements, design and implementation requirements and constraints, assumptions, and dependencies.</p>

        <h3>1.2. Intended Audience</h3>
        <p>The stakeholders for this document are as follows:
        <br><br><b>The developer, Benjamin Henning (me).</b>
        <br>The developer will be in charge of writing the SRS ahead of the product development, and will be the sole contributor to changes.
        <br>
        <br><b>Employers, recruiters and clients.</b>
        <br>This document will be publicly available, but the intended audience is anyone wishing to see how this project was created and developed, mainly employers, recruiters and clients. The document will aid in understanding the design process, intended features and functionality, and use cases of the application.</p>

        <h3>1.3. Intended Use</h3>
        <p>This document will be used in the following ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To develop a project timeline with weekly sprints and deadlines.</li>
            <li>To lay out requirements, features and functionality of the system to guide development.</li>
            <li>To describe use cases of the application for end users that will aid in testing and demonstration.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.4. Scope</h3>
        <p>The Issue Tracker application is intended to be used by development teams, project managers, and individuals to track software bugs and issues. The application will give users functionality to view, add, edit, delete, and mark solved bugs and issues. The application will allow an admin to give users roles that give varying levels of permissions to access and manage bug tracking.</p>

        <h3>1.5. Definitions</h3>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <th>Term</th>
                <th>Definition</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>User</td>
                <td>Someone who interacts with the Issue Tracking application</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Admin</td>
                <td>System administrator who is given specific permission for managing and controlling the system</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>CRUD</td>
                <td>Create, Read, Update and Delete. Describes how data is managed and viewed in a database-driven application.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>MVC</td>
                <td>Model, View, Controller - A popular software design pattern used to build web applications.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p>The issue tracker software will be a solution for Project Managers and Development Teams to track bugs and issues in their systems. The application will have CRUD functionality, meaning users and admins will be able to easily manage and store bug data in a relational database. The application be built using the MVC design pattern, so the code and file structure will be familiar to any third parties who view or work on the application after the development period.</p>

        <h3>2.1. User needs</h3>
        <p>The intended audience for the application is developers and people with basic technical knowledge. However, the application's functionality should be affordable to the point that non-technical users can intuitively use basic features.</p>

        <h3>2.2. Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p>It is assumed that this software will be used for its intended purpose, which is to track bugs and issues for a piece of software or a system. It is assumed that users will have a basic knowledge of bug tracking applications and how they function.</p>
